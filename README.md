# Leven

Leven is a lightweight Markdown-based static site generator for blogs.

## How do I get started?

Install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) if you haven't already.

```sh
cargo install leven
leven new amazing-blog
```

The rest of the instructions await you there.

## Is it any good?

Yes, it's *really* good. Trust me, the guy who made this, who has *absolutely no conflict of interest*, when I say that it's good. Because it is good. *Really* good. Seriously, though, it's incredibly simple and very, very fast.

## What's it bad at?

Well, if you want tags in your blog, or any kind of extra data attached to your blog posts at all, you've come to the wrong place.
